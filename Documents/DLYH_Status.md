# Don't Lose Your Head - Project Status

**Project:** Don't Lose Your Head (DLYH)
**Developer:** TecVooDoo LLC / Rune (Stephen Brandon)
**Platform:** Unity 6.3 (6000.0.38f1)
**Source:** `C:\Unity\DontLoseYourHead`
**Document Version:** 68
**Last Updated:** January 19, 2026

**Archive:** `DLYH_Status_Archive.md` - Historical designs, old version history, completed phase details, DAB reference patterns

## Quick Context

**What is this game?** A competitive word game combining Hangman's letter-guessing with Battleship's grid-based hidden information. Players place hidden words on grids and take turns guessing letters or coordinates to find opponent's words before the guillotine blade falls.

**Key Innovation:** Asymmetric difficulty - mixed-skill players compete fairly with different grid sizes, word counts, and difficulty settings.

**Current Phase:** Phase E - Networking & Auth

**Scene to Use:** NetworkingScene.unity

## Last Session (Jan 18, 2026)

Session 56 - **Resume Game Fixes & Editor Auth Discovery!**
- Fixed resume game data loading (decrypt placements, create models from Supabase data)
- Fixed Continue button, matchmaking queue error, added resume confirmation
- Fixed online waiting state (opponent shows "Waiting...", input blocked until opponent joins)
- Discovered editor auth issue - need persistent player ID for testing

---

## Active TODO

### Immediate: Editor Testing Identity (BLOCKER)

Without real OAuth, PlayerService creates new player records when name changes, breaking "My Active Games".

- [ ] **Add persistent player ID for Unity Editor**
  - Location: `PlayerService.cs` - modify `EnsurePlayerRecordAsync()`
  - Store player ID in PlayerPrefs on first creation
  - Load from PlayerPrefs on subsequent sessions
  - Only applies in Unity Editor (not builds)

### After Identity Fix

- [ ] **Test online game flow end-to-end**
  - Create private game -> show waiting -> opponent joins -> gameplay starts
  - Verify resume game works across editor sessions

### Phase E Remaining

**Auth:**
- [ ] Port auth UI from Dots and Boxes (Google/Facebook sign-in buttons)
- [ ] Persist name, color, preferences when signed in

**Multiplayer Flow:**
- [ ] Setup data exchange between players
- [ ] Turn synchronization
- [ ] State sync during gameplay
- [ ] Opponent disconnect/abandonment handling
- [ ] Rematch option after game end

**Async Gameplay:**
- [ ] 5-day inactivity = auto-win for last player who moved

### Phase F: Cleanup & Polish

- [ ] Remove legacy uGUI components
- [ ] Delete abandoned prefabs/scripts
- [ ] Namespace standardization (TecVooDoo.DontLoseYourHead.* or DLYH.*)
- [ ] Essential animations (guillotine blade drop, head fall)
- [ ] Screen transitions

### Phase G: Deploy to Playtest

- [ ] WebGL build pipeline
- [ ] Deploy to Cloudflare (dlyh.pages.dev)
- [ ] Mobile browser testing & fixes
- [ ] Verify telemetry working

---

## Known Issues

**UI/Layout:**
- UI elements overlap when viewport resized to smaller sizes (no CSS media queries in UI Toolkit)
- **MOBILE BLOCKER:** Bottom buttons inaccessible on mobile - mobile play impossible until fixed

**Architecture:**
- UIFlowController at ~5500 lines (could extract networking helpers if needed)
- Inconsistent namespace convention (TecVooDoo.DontLoseYourHead.* vs DLYH.*)

**Networking:**
- **BLOCKER:** Editor testing has no persistent identity (PlayerService creates new player on name change)
- Realtime subscription for opponent joining not yet implemented (polling placeholder exists)
- Full multiplayer gameplay not yet tested (setup exchange, turns, state sync)

**Audio:**
- Music crossfading/switching too frequently (should only switch at end of track)

---

## What Works (Completed Features)

**Core Mechanics:**
- Grid placement and word entry
- Letter, coordinate, and word guessing
- Miss limit calculation formula
- Win and loss condition detection
- Extra turn on word completion (queued if multiple)

**AI Opponent ("The Executioner"):**
- Adaptive difficulty with rubber-banding
- Strategy switching (letter, coordinate, word guesses)
- Memory-based decision making
- Variable think times (0.8-2.5s)

**Audio:**
- Music playback with shuffle and crossfade
- SFX system with mute controls
- Dynamic tempo changes under danger
- Guillotine execution sound sequence

**Telemetry:**
- Cloudflare workers endpoint for event capture
- Session, game, guess, feedback, and error tracking

**UI Toolkit (Phases A-D Complete):**
- TableModel/TableView data-driven grid
- Setup wizard with progressive card disclosure
- Word rows with variable lengths (3,4,5,6)
- Autocomplete dropdown for word entry
- 8-direction grid placement with preview
- Main menu with inline settings
- Hamburger menu navigation
- Attack/Defend tab switching
- Guillotine overlay with 5-stage visual
- Game end sequence with animations
- How to Play modal

**Networking UI (Phase E In Progress):**
- Online mode choice (Find Opponent vs Private Game)
- MatchmakingOverlay, WaitingRoom, JoinCodeEntry overlays
- NetworkingUIManager manages all overlays
- Phantom AI fallback with random names
- Private Game creates Supabase record with join code
- JoinCodeEntry looks up and joins existing games
- "My Active Games" list on main menu
- Resume game loads state from Supabase
- Waiting state blocks input until opponent joins

## Architecture

### Key Scripts

| Script | Lines | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| UIFlowController | ~5500 | Screen flow + gameplay + modals + networking |
| SetupWizardUIManager | ~820 | Setup wizard flow |
| GameplayScreenManager | ~650 | Gameplay UI state, tab switching, keyboard |
| GuillotineOverlayManager | ~450 | Guillotine overlay modal controller |
| NetworkingUIManager | ~640 | Networking overlay management |
| ExecutionerAI | ~493 | AI opponent coordination |

### Namespaces

| Namespace | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `TecVooDoo.DontLoseYourHead.UI` | Main UI scripts |
| `TecVooDoo.DontLoseYourHead.Core` | Game state, difficulty |

```

### Opponent Abstraction

Game logic is opponent-agnostic. Whether AI, Phantom AI, or Remote Player:
1. Fires `OnOpponentTurnStarted` event
2. Waits for guess via `IOpponent.OnLetterGuess` / `OnCoordinateGuess` / `OnWordGuess`
3. Processes guess using SAME code path as player guesses
4. Updates UI using `IOpponent.OpponentColor`
5. Fires `OnOpponentTurnEnded` event

**Important:** Use `_opponent` (not `_aiOpponent`), handlers are `HandleOpponent*`, `CellOwner` only has `Player` and `Opponent`.

---

## Game Rules

### Core Concept
DLYH is Battleship with words. Both players see Attack and Defend boards - Attack shows opponent's hidden words (where you guess), Defend shows your words (what opponent found).

### Turn Flow
1. First turn random
2. Make ONE action: pick letter, pick coordinate, or guess word
3. Turn switches (except: extra turn on word completion)

### Actions

**Pick Letter:** Hit = letter fills in word rows (yellow or player color based on coordinate knowledge). Miss = +1 miss.

**Pick Coordinate:** Hit = cell highlights (yellow if letter unknown, player color if known). Miss = +1 miss.

**Guess Word:** Correct = word fills in + extra turn. Incorrect = +2 misses.

### Color Rules
- Red = Miss
- Yellow = Hit but incomplete (letter OR coordinate unknown)
- Player Color = Fully known (both letter AND coordinate)

### Miss Limit Formula
```
MissLimit = 15 + OpponentGridBonus + OpponentWordModifier + YourDifficultyModifier

OpponentGridBonus: 6x6=+3, 7x7=+4, 8x8=+6, 9x9=+8, 10x10=+10, 11x11=+12, 12x12=+13
OpponentWordModifier: 3 words=+0, 4 words=-2
YourDifficultyModifier: Easy=+4, Normal=+0, Hard=-4
```

### Win Conditions
1. Reveal ALL opponent's words AND grid coordinates
2. Opponent reaches miss limit
3. (Online) Opponent abandons after 5 days

## Lessons Learned

### Unity/C# Patterns
1. **Set state BEFORE firing events** - handlers may check state immediately
2. **Initialize UI to known states** - don't rely on defaults
3. **Kill DOTween before reset** - prevents animation conflicts
4. **Store original positions** - for proper reset after animations
5. **Use New Input System** - `Keyboard.current`, not `Input.GetKeyDown`
6. **No `var` keyword** - explicit types always
7. **800 lines max** - extract controllers when approaching limit
8. **Prefer UniTask over coroutines** - `await UniTask.Delay(1000)`
9. **No allocations in Update** - cache references, use object pooling
10. **Validate after MCP edits** - run validate_script to catch syntax errors

### Project-Specific
11. **Unity 6 UIDocument bug (IN-127759)** - assign Source Asset to prevent blue screen
12. **Use E: drive path** - never worktree paths
13. **Check scene file diffs** - layout can be accidentally modified
14. **Reuse existing systems** - create thin adapters instead of rebuilding
15. **Prevent duplicate event handlers** - use flags like `_keyboardWiredUp`
16. **Reset validity on clear** - SetWordValid(false) when clearing words

## Bug Patterns to Avoid

| Bug Pattern | Cause | Prevention |
|-------------|-------|------------|
| State set AFTER events | Handlers see stale state | Set state BEFORE firing events |
| Autocomplete floating at top | Not hidden at init | Call Hide() in Initialize() |
| Board not resetting | No reset logic | Call ResetGameplayState() on new game |
| Guillotine head stuck | No stored position | Store original position on Initialize |
| Green cells after clear | Validity not reset | SetWordValid(false) in HandleWordCleared |
| Old screen still visible | Only showing new | Hide ALL other screens when showing new |
| Unicode not rendering in WebGL | Font support | Use ASCII fallbacks |

---

## Coding Standards

- Prefer async/await (UniTask) over coroutines
- Avoid allocations in Update
- No per-frame LINQ
- Clear separation between logic and UI
- ASCII-only documentation and identifiers
- No `var` keyword - explicit types always
- 800-1200 lines per file (extract when exceeding with clear responsibilities)

---

## Development Priorities (Ordered)

1. **SOLID principles first**
2. **Memory efficiency second** - no per-frame allocations
3. **Clean code third** - readable, maintainable
4. **Self-documenting code fourth** - clear naming over comments
5. **Platform best practices fifth** - Unity > C#, Cloudflare/Supabase > HTML/JS

---

## AI Rules

1. **Verify names exist** - search before referencing files/methods/classes
2. **Step-by-step verification** - one step at a time, wait for confirmation
3. **Read before editing** - always read files before modifying
4. **ASCII only** - no smart quotes, em-dashes, or special characters
5. **Prefer structured edits** - use script_apply_edits for method changes
6. **Be direct** - give honest assessments, don't sugar-coat
