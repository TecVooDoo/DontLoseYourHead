DON'T LOSE YOUR HEAD
Hangman meets Battleship in a medieval carnival of word warfare
THE HOOK
A competitive word puzzle game where players hide words on a grid and race to find their opponent's words before the guillotine blade falls. Each wrong guess raises the blade higher.
KEY INNOVATION
Asymmetric Difficulty System: Players choose independent grid sizes (6x6 to 12x12), word counts, and difficulty settings. A parent and child can compete fairly - the experienced player handicaps themselves with a harder configuration.
CORE MECHANICS
• Three guess types: letters, coordinates, or full words
• Three-color feedback system (hit/miss/unknown)
• Extra turns for completing words
• Visual guillotine tension meter
• Dynamic facial expressions react to game stateTARGET AUDIENCE
• Word game enthusiasts (Wordle, crossword fans)
• Families seeking mixed-skill competitive play
• Casual strategy gamers
